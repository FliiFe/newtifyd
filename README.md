# newtifyd

This project aims at making a slick and modern notification daemon.

It is currently in very early development and can be buggy.

## Running

Node and npm are required.

First time:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FliiFe/newtifyd.git
cd newtifyd
npm i
npm run build
```

Then to start the daemon
```bash
npm run start
```

You need to make sure no other daemon is running.
